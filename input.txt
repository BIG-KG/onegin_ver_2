 Thus a young scapegrace thought
  as with post horses in the dust he flew,
  by the most lofty will of Zeus
   the heir of all his kin.
  Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
  The hero of my novel,
  without preambles, forthwith,
   I'd like to have you meet:
  Onegin, a good pal of mine,
  was born upon the Neva's banks,
  where maybe you were born,
   or used to shine, my reader!
  There formerly I too promenaded
  but harmful is the North to me.1
