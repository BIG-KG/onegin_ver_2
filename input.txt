  1 Thus a young scapegrace thought
  2 as with post horses in the dust he flew,
  3 by the most lofty will of Zeus
  4 the heir of all his kin.
  5 Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
  6 The hero of my novel,
  7 without preambles, forthwith,
  8 I'd like to have you meet:
  9 Onegin, a good pal of mine,
  10 was born upon the Neva's banks,
  11 where maybe you were born,
  12 or used to shine, my reader!
  13 There formerly I too promenaded
  14 but harmful is the North to me.1
